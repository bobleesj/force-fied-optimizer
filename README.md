# Ch393 IS Force-Field Optimizer 
The project takes in an input file in .xyz and returns the optimized structure in .xyz with the associated energy value.

## Overall Strategy
1.	determine the xyz of each Ar atom by parsing the XYZ file.
2.	determine the distance (r) between the two atoms as a function of x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, y3.
3.	determine the potential using the distance in 2.
4.	update the XYZ coordinates of the two atoms as guided by the Nelder Mead  algorithm.
